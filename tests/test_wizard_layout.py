"""Layout / responsive regression tests for the Textual wizard.

The wizard is driven entirely by keyboard, and its action row (Back /
Next / Apply) is the only way forward on every screen. Before the
scrolling-body refactor, several screens rendered that row *below* the
bottom of the terminal at common sizes — Configure (SBOM) did it at
80x24, the out-of-the-box default of xterm, gnome-terminal,
Terminal.app, Konsole and Alacritty — leaving the user with no visible
way to continue. Nothing in the suite noticed, because every existing
test asserts on widget state rather than on where widgets land.

These tests close that gap: they walk the real screens at a matrix of
real terminal sizes and assert the action row is inside the viewport.
