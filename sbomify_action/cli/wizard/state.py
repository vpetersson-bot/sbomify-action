"""State model for the wizard.

The model is deliberately split into three pieces:

  - ``RepoFacts`` — read-only observations of the working tree (immutable
    for the session).
  - ``WorkspaceSnapshot`` — what we learned by talking to sbomify after
    the user authenticated.
  - ``Plan`` — the staged set of mutations the user has agreed to.

Phases 1–4 of the wizard only mutate the ``Plan``. The apply phase is
the only place that performs writes or API mutations, so ``Ctrl-C`` and
``--dry-run`` are trivially safe.
