"""Textual entrypoint for the sbomify wizard.

The wizard is a stack of ``WizardScreen`` subclasses. Each screen
reads from / writes to a single shared ``WizardState`` instance on the
app so state survives screen transitions. Background I/O runs on
``@work(thread=True)`` workers, so the UI never blocks.

Phases (``step_index`` on each ``WizardScreen``):

  1. welcome              — hero, repo summary, start button
  2. discover             — multi-select lockfiles
  3. authenticate         — token entry + parallel workspace prefetch
  4. product              — pick existing or create new
  5. components           — pick existing or create per lockfile
  6. configure (workflow) — release strategy + credential + augmentation
  7. configure (SBOM)     — enrichment / formats / attestation /
                            (when augmentation=profile) profile picker /
                            (when augmentation=json_config) push to
                            configure (sbomify.json) for the in-repo
                            metadata form
  8. review + apply        — table of planned writes → RichLog progress
  9. publish + done        — optional local generate-and-upload of the
                             first SBOMs (one pipeline subprocess per
                             matrix row) → summary panel + OIDC
