"""Shared screen scaffolding for the wizard.

``WizardScreen`` provides the consistent visual frame every screen
uses: a Textual ``Header``, a body region the subclass fills, and a
``Footer`` with keybind hints. Subclasses override
``compose_body`` and the ``step_index`` / ``step_title`` class vars.

The crumb at the top of every screen renders the wizard's progress
as a connected segmented track + a numbered position chip + the
current step title. Keeping it consistent across screens means users
always see where they are without needing to re-orient.
