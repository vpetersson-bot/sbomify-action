# The sbomify marketing tagline. Same words as the home page hero.

# marketing site uses for the homepage title.

# ASCII wizard mascot. Built from common ASCII art conventions (the
# /\ hat outline, WWW beard pattern, ( o o ) face) rather than copied
# from any one artist — a real wizard hat is at least as tall as the
# face + beard, which is what the previous draft was missing.
#
# Rows are colored to echo the sbomify gradient: peach hat tip,
# magenta hat base with stars, silvery beard (Gandalf cue), blue
# robe deepening to brand-primary at the hem. Pure ASCII (no
# box-drawing or exotic Unicode) so the figure renders uniformly
# across terminals and SSH sessions.
#
# The rows below are PLAIN TEXT. ``_build_mascot`` assembles them into a
# styled ``rich.text.Text`` — deliberately NOT a markup string.
#
# This art is almost entirely backslashes, and a backslash adjacent to a
# tag is an escape character in both markup dialects in play here. As
# hand-written markup, ``/\[/]`` made the top of the hat render as
# ``/[/]``: right edge eaten, closing tag printed as literal text. And
# the two dialects disagree on the fix — ``rich.markup.escape`` doubles a
# trailing backslash, which Rich unescapes but Textual's own parser
# renders as ``\`` *plus* a literal ``[/]``. Building a Text with explicit
# style spans sidesteps markup parsing altogether, so no escaping rule has
# to be right.
