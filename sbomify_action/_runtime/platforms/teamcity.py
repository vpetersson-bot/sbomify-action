"""TeamCity platform.

Ported from the TeamCity augmentation provider: the extraction logic below is
unchanged, only its shell moved so TeamCity is a CI platform like any other.

This provider detects when running under JetBrains TeamCity and extracts VCS
information. Unlike GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / Bitbucket Pipelines, TeamCity
exposes almost nothing useful as an environment variable -- only these are
automatic on a build agent:

- TEAMCITY_VERSION: Detection (present when running under TeamCity)
- BUILD_VCS_NUMBER: The VCS revision of the primary VCS root
- TEAMCITY_BUILD_PROPERTIES_FILE: Path to the build properties file

The repository URL (``vcsroot.<VCS_root_ID>.url``) and branch
(``teamcity.build.branch``) are TeamCity *configuration parameters*, not
environment variables. They are reachable only by reading the build properties
file and following its ``teamcity.configuration.properties.file`` key to a
second file holding the configuration parameters.

Resolution order (``sbomify.json``, at priority 10, still beats all of it):

1. The build properties file -- zero configuration, works out of the box.
2. ``SBOMIFY_VCS_URL`` / ``SBOMIFY_VCS_REF`` -- for setups where the properties
   file is not readable, most commonly when the action runs inside a container
   that does not have the agent temp directory mounted.

TeamCity is VCS-agnostic: a VCS root may be Subversion, Perforce, TFVC,
Mercurial, or anything a third-party plugin adds. ``BUILD_VCS_NUMBER`` is a
commit hash only under Git. Because the SBOM VCS fields are Git-shaped end to
end (``git+https://...@sha`` locators), this platform is **default-deny**: it
emits nothing unless something positively identifies the root as Git. See
``_looks_like_git_root``.

Most TeamCity build configurations attach a single VCS root, and that is the
path optimised here: with one root TeamCity emits the bare forms
(``vcsroot.url``, ``BUILD_VCS_NUMBER``, ``build.vcs.number``) and every lookup
below resolves on its first tier. The per-root (``vcsroot.<id>.url``,
``BUILD_VCS_NUMBER_<id>``) handling is a fallback for multi-root builds, where
the bare forms are absent entirely -- it never executes for the common case.

``DISABLE_VCS_AUGMENTATION=true`` suppresses VCS enrichment, but nothing in
this module reads it. The switch is not per-platform: it is enforced once, in
``CIPlatformProvider``, so it applies wherever the action runs. ``vcs()`` here
always reports what it finds -- a direct caller gets metadata regardless.

    Decide whether the chosen VCS root is positively identifiable as Git.

    TeamCity's VCS support is plugin-extensible, so the set of non-Git types is
    open-ended and cannot be enumerated for rejection. The only sound posture is
    default-deny: emit nothing unless something says "this is Git".

    **TeamCity exposes no VCS-type information whatsoever.** Verified on
    2024.12.3, 2025.03.3, 2025.07.3, 2025.11.7 and 2026.1.3 with a real Git
    checkout: there is no ``vcsroot.<id>.type`` parameter, and a root created
    with only url+branch exposes *only* ``vcsroot.<id>.url`` and
    ``vcsroot.<id>.branch`` -- git-plugin properties such as ``usernameStyle``
    appear only when explicitly configured, so their presence cannot be used as
    a marker either.

    That is why this function takes only the URL: there is nothing else in the
    build properties for it to consult. A revision's
    *shape* is deliberately not a signal: Fossil and Monotone also produce
    40/64-hex content hashes, so hex length narrows the field without ever
    proving Git. It gates the SHA only, in :func:`_select_commit_sha`.

    Consequence, documented in the README: a self-hosted Git server whose URL
    has no ``.git`` suffix and is not on a known host cannot be auto-detected;
    those users set ``SBOMIFY_VCS_URL`` or ``sbomify.json``.
